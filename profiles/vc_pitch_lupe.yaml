  - "Target €30K MRR by July"

narrative_elevator_pitch: |
  Mobile developers spend millions on UA across Facebook, TikTok, Applovin —
  but they're flying blind. Campaign data is fragmented, reporting is manual,
  and by the time insights surface, budgets are wasted.

  Lupe Analytics gives every mobile developer the analytics infrastructure of a
  top publisher. Single source of truth in their warehouse, domain-specific
  models, and AI that tells them what's working and what to do next.

preferred_moves:
  - "Ask calibrated questions to uncover decision process"
  - "Use labeling/mirroring on objections"
  - "Bridge back to traction + next steps"
