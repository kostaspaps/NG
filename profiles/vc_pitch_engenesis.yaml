name: "VC Pitch — Engenesis Ventures (Ariya Chittasy)"
mode: VC_PITCH

goals:
  primary: "Evaluate whether Engenesis' services-for-equity model actually adds value for Lupe"
  secondary:
    - "Understand exactly what services they provide and whether we need them (we already have strong product + engineering)"
    - "Assess their B2B SaaS experience and investor network — these are the only things that matter to us"
    - "Position Lupe as a scalable tech venture, not a services business"
    - "Do NOT agree to anything on this call — gather information only"

constraints:
  do_not_reveal:
    - "Exact pilot pricing unless directly asked"
    - "Weaknesses in customer pipeline"
  do_not_commit:
    - "Equity terms or percentages without reviewing their standard deal structure"
    - "Using their tech/dev services if we don't need them — we have strong technical founders"
    - "Any fee-for-service engagement without understanding ROI"

tone:
  default: "calm, sharp, confident — founder-to-founder energy"
  if_skeptical: "evidence-based, show traction numbers, no defensiveness"
  if_aggressive: "firm, polite, redirect to product differentiation and market size"

key_points:
  - "We're building the analytics infrastructure that big mobile publishers have in-house — for everyone else"
  - "Warehouse-native, no data movement: lower cost, better security, user-level granularity"
  - "Domain knowledge woven into the data models, not just a generic BI tool"
  - "AI agents that surface insights and recommend actions — not just dashboards"
  - "Clear DACH beachhead with a globally relevant product (mobile app economy is borderless)"
  - "Two complementary founders covering business, product, full-stack, data, and ML"
  - "Pilot with active customer, second onboarding, third in pipeline"
  - "Target €30K MRR by July"

narrative_elevator_pitch: |
  Mobile developers spend millions on user acquisition across Facebook, TikTok,
  and Applovin — but they're flying blind. Campaign data is fragmented across
  platforms, reporting is manual, and by the time insights surface, budgets have
  already been wasted.

  Big companies like Supercell or King solve this with 10-person analytics teams
  and custom infrastructure. Everyone else is stuck with spreadsheets and gut feel.

  Lupe Analytics gives every mobile developer the analytics infrastructure of a
  top publisher. We create a single source of truth directly in their data
  warehouse — no data movement, no overhead. On top, we layer data models with
  deep domain knowledge and AI that surfaces what's working, what's not, and
  what to do next.

  We're running a pilot with an active customer, just onboarded a second customer,
  and have a third in our pipeline. Our target is €30K MRR by July.

preferred_moves:
  - "Ask calibrated questions about their venture builder model and what portfolio support looks like"
  - "Use labeling/mirroring on objections"
  - "Bridge back to traction, product differentiation, and global market opportunity"
  - "Emphasize we're a product company with strong tech — we need distribution and network, not dev help"
  - "Ask about their Genesis Framework and how it applies to data/analytics ventures"

special_context:
  venture_builder_model: |
    Engenesis is NOT a traditional VC fund and NOT a capital investment fund —
    they are a venture builder. They do NOT inject cash.
    Their model: they take equity stakes in exchange for providing venture-building
    services (strategy, product design, software development, marketing).
    Typically they cover ~50% of the cost of their services in exchange for equity
    at your current valuation. So it's a services-for-equity swap, not a cash injection.
    Be clear about what WE need: likely their network, go-to-market support,
    and investor introductions — NOT their tech/dev services (we have strong
    technical co-founders). Frame it as partnership, not dependency.
    Key risk: if their services don't match what we actually need (we already
    have strong product + engineering), the equity cost may not be worth it.

  investor_background: |
    Ariya Chittasy is Director of Engenesis Ventures. Entrepreneur with 8 years
    building 4 companies, led award-winning ventures in Asia-Pacific, scaled
    teams from 4 to 70+ in under 2 years. Ashkan is CEO/founder of Engenesis
    and the Being Profile, author of the BEING book — he brings an ontological
    (personal transformation) angle to venture building. They emphasize founder
    personal growth driving professional success.

  fund_details: |
    Sydney-based, operating in 45+ countries. Studied 3,200+ companies,
    worked directly with 800+. Portfolio includes ventures in 53+ countries.
    Notable exits: OneSend (acquired by ActiveCampaign), Price My Car
    (acquired by CarExpert.com.au). They have the Genesis Framework —
    an ontological venture building methodology. Focus on MVP-stage startups
    and growth-stage scaleups.

  portfolio_context: |
    Current portfolio includes Xeali (business management for coaches/consultants),
    Frank Food Safety Systems (IoT food safety), D-Risk (FinTech AI for
    investment banking). No direct competitor to Lupe in their portfolio —
    we'd be their first marketing analytics / data infrastructure venture.
    This is an opportunity: we bring a new vertical they don't have.

  questions_for_ariya:
    - "Do you have experience working with B2B SaaS companies specifically? What does your track record look like there?"
    - "Walk me through a typical cooperation — what's the timeline, what equity stake, and what services do you actually deliver?"
    - "How do you connect your portfolio companies to investors? What does your investor network look like?"
    - "You've worked with 800+ startups — what patterns do you see in the ones that break through from MVP to scale?"
    - "Your portfolio spans 53+ countries. For a B2B product targeting mobile developers, what go-to-market approach has worked best?"
    - "The 50% services-for-equity model — how do you determine the valuation, and what happens if we only need a subset of your services?"

  tough_question_responses:
    why_not_self_funded: "We are revenue-focused — the pilot is our #1 priority. But the right partner accelerates go-to-market and opens doors that would take us 12+ months to open alone."
    services_vs_product: "Everything is productized. We deploy standardized data models directly into customer warehouses — same playbook every time. The AI layer is the same for every customer. This scales like software, not services."
    small_team: "Two founders covering business, product, full-stack, data, and ML. We've built in 6 months what would take a 5-person team a year. We're looking for a partner to accelerate distribution, not engineering."
    why_engenesis: "Your global network across 45+ countries and hands-on venture building experience is exactly what we need to go from DACH to global. Plus, no one in your portfolio does what we do — we'd be a new vertical."
    european_market: "DACH is our beachhead — Germany is growing fastest in Europe at 18.5% CAGR for marketing analytics. But mobile UA is inherently global. The product works anywhere there are app developers spending on campaigns."
    why_give_equity: "We'd only consider equity if the value delivered clearly exceeds what we'd pay in cash. We need to understand exactly what services you'd provide, what the timeline looks like, and how your investor network translates into concrete introductions."
    dont_need_dev: "We have two deeply technical co-founders covering full-stack, data engineering, ML, and product. We've built everything ourselves in 6 months. We don't need development services — if anything, we need go-to-market and investor access."
