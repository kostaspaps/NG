mode: VC_PITCH

goals:
  primary: "Get to next meeting + secure interest from 42CAP"
  secondary:
    - "Position Lupe as the AI Data Teammate replacing 10-person analytics teams"
    - "Create urgency without sounding desperate"
    - "Land the message: deterministic AI on verified data, not another chatbot on SQL"

constraints:
  do_not_reveal:
    - "Exact pilot pricing unless directly asked"
    - "Weaknesses in customer pipeline"

  if_skeptical: "curious, evidence-based, no defensiveness"
  if_aggressive: "firm, polite, boundary-setting"

key_points:
  - "Lupe is the AI Data Teammate for mobile growth — enabling SMB studios to operate with the analytical power of a 10-person data and growth team, without the headcount"
  - "We unify attribution, marketing, and product data into a single source of truth, then layer deterministic, auditable AI on top"
  - "Lupe does NOT generate SQL — it enforces truth through a verified semantic layer built on user-level data"
  - "One definition of revenue, ROAS, and LTV everywhere — fully auditable answers that survive board scrutiny"
  - "No existing solution unifies user-level attribution + product behavior + marketing spend + AI-ready semantic definitions"

  - "Raising €1.3M seed for 12 months runway"

narrative_elevator_pitch: |
  Mobile studios run on fragmented, conflicting data. Facebook, TikTok, AppLovin
  all claim credit. MMPs track attribution. Product tools track engagement.
  Finance asks for revenue truth. Dashboards are easy to build — reliable answers
  are not.

  Studios that spend at scale solve this with large in-house data teams.
  SMBs compete against them without the people, time, or budget.

  Lupe gives every mobile studio the analytical power of the best-in-class teams
  — without hiring one. We create a single source of truth directly in their data
  warehouse, enforce it through a verified semantic layer, and layer deterministic
  AI on top. No guessing how metrics should be calculated — one definition of
  revenue, ROAS, and LTV everywhere.

  This approach was not feasible until now. We are pre-scale, not pre-product.

preferred_moves:
  - "Ask calibrated questions to uncover decision process"
  - "Use labeling/mirroring on objections"
  - "Bridge back to traction and next steps"
  - "Proactively raise Adverity differentiation before Julian does"
  - "When asked 'what do you do' — lead with the problem (fragmented data, no truth), then the breakthrough (semantic layer, deterministic AI)"
  - "When asked about AI — emphasize 'we do NOT generate SQL, we enforce truth' to differentiate from generic AI tools"

special_context:
  product_overview: |
    Lupe is an agentic analytics platform with three interfaces:
    - Lupe Console: dashboards, data models, configuration
    - AI Assistant: ask questions in natural language, get charts, reports, and written insights
    - Slack Bot: insights, alerts, and root-cause analysis where teams already work
    Behind the scenes, autonomous agents forecast LTV/ROAS, monitor performance,
    detect anomalies, and recommend concrete budget actions.

  use_cases: |
    What customers use Lupe for:
    - Ads Co-Pilot: scale winners, cut losers, protect spend
    - AI Q&A: "What changed yesterday?" answered in seconds
    - Auto Reporting: daily & weekly exec summaries, one shared narrative
    - Deterministic Alerting: math-based alerts, not model guesses
    From insight → explanation → action, in one system.

  the_breakthrough: |
    Lupe does not generate SQL. It enforces truth.
    Instead of letting AI "guess" how metrics should be calculated, Lupe routes
    every question through a verified semantic layer built on user-level data.
    Result: one definition of revenue, ROAS, and LTV everywhere. Fully auditable
    answers that survive board scrutiny. AI that can be trusted with real money decisions.

  why_we_win: |
    No existing solution unifies: user-level attribution, product behavior,
    marketing spend, and AI-ready semantic definitions. Competitors solve pieces
    of the problem. Lupe replaces the entire analytics decision layer — without
    requiring a data team.

  the_ask: |
    Raising €1.3M Seed for 12 months runway.
    Focus: complete first paid pilots, lock multi-tenant architecture, scale GTM in Europe.
    Milestones: 10+ paying studios, €30K+ MRR, clear PMF signal in SMB mobile publishers.

  traction: |
    Current MRR: €4K. Paying customers: 1 (active pilot). Target MRR Jul 2025: €30K.
    Team: 2 founders. We are pre-scale, not pre-product.

  team_background: |
    Founded by Kostas & Claudia, who spent six years building data systems for
    mobile gaming companies. Previously built the analytics infrastructure at
    Popcore, supporting its acquisition by Zynga (Take-Two Interactive).
    We combine: deep mobile adtech expertise, production-grade data engineering,
    speed of execution from operators, not consultants.

  adverity_differentiation: |
    42CAP has Adverity in their portfolio. When this comes up:
    "Adverity solves the data plumbing problem — getting marketing data into
    one place. We start where they stop. Lupe works directly in the customer's
    warehouse with user-level data, adds a semantic layer with domain-specific
    models, and uses AI to surface the insights that actually drive campaign
    decisions. We're complementary, not competitive."

  investor_background: |
    Julian von Fischer is a founder-turned-VC. He co-founded Karlsson (digital
    health insurance, Munich), went through WERK1 and Xpreneurs, then shut it
    down. He values authenticity and directness — he wrote that most startup
    advice "is not honest enough." His Novee AI deal (AI for insurance
    underwriting) shows he invests in domain-specific AI. KPMG Financial
    Services background means he appreciates data rigor and ROI clarity.

  fund_details: |
    42CAP Fund IV. Seed check size €0.5–3M. Focus: B2B Software, Data-Driven,
    AI/ML. Europe with global ambition. ~20 companies, concentrated bets.
    Target €500M+ valuation in 7–8 years.

  questions_for_julian:
    - "The 42CAP partners built eCircle and ran Teradata's Marketing Cloud. How does the team see the MarTech landscape evolving around user-level analytics?"
    - "With Adverity in the portfolio, do you see an opportunity in the intelligence layer on top of data integration?"
    - "Your conversion rate to Series A is close to 100%. What do you look for at seed to build that confidence?"
    - "You founded Karlsson and went through WERK1 — what's the most important lesson you took into investing?"

  tough_question_responses:
    runway_question: "We are focused on revenue — the pilot is our #1 priority. But we're also having smart conversations with investors who understand the space."
    valuation_question: "Marketing analytics is a €12B market by 2030. If we nail warehouse-native + AI for mobile, expansion into e-commerce, gaming, and fintech apps is natural."
    unfair_advantage: "Six years building analytics for mobile gaming, including the data infrastructure behind Popcore's acquisition by Zynga. Deep domain expertise in mobile UA + technical depth (Snowflake, dbt, multi-agent AI). We've built what would take a competitor 6-12 months to replicate."
    why_now: "Privacy changes (ATT, SKAdNetwork) broke traditional attribution. Companies are rebuilding analytics around first-party, user-level data — exactly what we enable."
    why_not_just_bi_tool: "Dashboards are easy to build. Reliable answers are not. Generic BI tools let you query data — they don't enforce truth. Lupe's semantic layer guarantees one definition of revenue, ROAS, LTV everywhere. That's the difference between a dashboard and a decision system."
    what_about_ai_competitors: "Most AI analytics tools generate SQL from natural language — that's a parlor trick. If the underlying data is wrong or undefined, the AI confidently gives wrong answers. We enforce truth first, then let AI operate on verified definitions. Deterministic, auditable, trustworthy."
    only_one_customer: "We are pre-scale, not pre-product. The product is live, the pilot is paying, and we're onboarding more. We chose to go deep with one customer to nail the value prop before scaling."
