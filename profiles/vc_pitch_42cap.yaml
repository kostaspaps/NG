mode: VC_PITCH

goals:
  primary: "Get to next meeting + secure interest from 42CAP"
  secondary:
    - "Position Lupe as category-defining analytics infrastructure"
    - "Create urgency without sounding desperate"

constraints:
  do_not_reveal:
    - "Exact pilot pricing unless directly asked"
    - "Weaknesses in customer pipeline"
  do_not_commit:
    - "Custom features without timeline review"

tone:
  default: "calm, sharp, confident"
  if_skeptical: "curious, evidence-based, no defensiveness"
  if_aggressive: "firm, polite, boundary-setting"

key_points:
  - "We're building the analytics infrastructure that big mobile publishers have in-house — for everyone else"
  - "Warehouse-native, no data movement: lower cost, better security, user-level granularity"
  - "Domain knowledge woven into the data models, not just a generic BI tool"
  - "Clear DACH beachhead with a globally relevant product (mobile app economy is borderless)"
  - "Two complementary founders covering business, product, full-stack, data, and ML"
  - "Pilot with active customer, second onboarding, third in pipeline"
  - "Target €30K MRR by July"

narrative_elevator_pitch: |
  Mobile developers spend millions on user acquisition across Facebook, TikTok,
  and Applovin — but they're flying blind. Campaign data is fragmented across
  platforms, reporting is manual, and by the time insights surface, budgets have
  already been wasted.

  Big companies like Supercell or King solve this with 10-person analytics teams
  and custom infrastructure. Everyone else is stuck with spreadsheets and gut feel.

  Lupe Analytics gives every mobile developer the analytics infrastructure of a
  top publisher. We create a single source of truth directly in their data
  warehouse — no data movement, no overhead. On top, we layer data models with
  deep domain knowledge and AI that surfaces what's working, what's not, and
  what to do next.

  We're running a pilot with an active customer, just onboarded a second customer,
  and have a third in our pipeline. Our target is €30K MRR by July.

preferred_moves:
  - "Ask calibrated questions to uncover decision process"
  - "Use labeling/mirroring on objections"
  - "Bridge back to traction and next steps"
  - "Proactively raise Adverity differentiation before Julian does"

special_context:
  adverity_differentiation: |
    42CAP has Adverity in their portfolio. When this comes up:
    "Adverity solves the data plumbing problem — getting marketing data into
    one place. We start where they stop. Lupe works directly in the customer's
    warehouse with user-level data, adds a semantic layer with domain-specific
    models, and uses AI to surface the insights that actually drive campaign
    decisions. We're complementary, not competitive."

  investor_background: |
    Julian von Fischer is a founder-turned-VC. He co-founded Karlsson (digital
    health insurance, Munich), went through WERK1 and Xpreneurs, then shut it
    down. He values authenticity and directness — he wrote that most startup
    advice "is not honest enough." His Novee AI deal (AI for insurance
    underwriting) shows he invests in domain-specific AI. KPMG Financial
    Services background means he appreciates data rigor and ROI clarity.

  fund_details: |
    42CAP Fund IV. Seed check size €0.5–3M. Focus: B2B Software, Data-Driven,
    AI/ML. Europe with global ambition. ~20 companies, concentrated bets.
    Target €500M+ valuation in 7–8 years.

  questions_for_julian:
    - "The 42CAP partners built eCircle and ran Teradata's Marketing Cloud. How does the team see the MarTech landscape evolving around user-level analytics?"
    - "With Adverity in the portfolio, do you see an opportunity in the intelligence layer on top of data integration?"
    - "Your conversion rate to Series A is close to 100%. What do you look for at seed to build that confidence?"
    - "You founded Karlsson and went through WERK1 — what's the most important lesson you took into investing?"

  tough_question_responses:
    runway_question: "We are focused on revenue — the pilot is our #1 priority. But we're also having smart conversations with investors who understand the space."
    valuation_question: "Marketing analytics is a €12B market by 2030. If we nail warehouse-native + AI for mobile, expansion into e-commerce, gaming, and fintech apps is natural."
    unfair_advantage: "Deep domain expertise in mobile UA + technical depth (Snowflake, dbt, multi-agent AI). We've built what would take a competitor 6-12 months to replicate."
    why_now: "Privacy changes (ATT, SKAdNetwork) broke traditional attribution. Companies are rebuilding analytics around first-party, user-level data — exactly what we enable."
