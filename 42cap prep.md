# **About Julian von Fischer**

**Background:** Julian is a founder-turned-VC. He co-founded **Karlsson**, a Munich-based digital health insurance startup (supplementary health insurance for digital natives). He went through the WERK1 Insurtech Accelerator and UnternehmerTUM Xpreneurs program before eventually deciding to shut the company down and transition into investing. Before Karlsson, he built two ventures during his student days (including a video game resale business at 17 and a tutoring platform). He started his career at KPMG in Financial Services consulting.

**Education:** B.A. from University of St. Gallen, MSc from Copenhagen Business School (Management of Innovation & Business Development).

**Investment style:** Julian focuses on pre-seed and seed-stage B2B SaaS across Europe. He has been involved in deals including **Qdrant** (vector database), **Novee AI** (AI for insurance underwriting), **Fuzzy Logic Robotics**, and **Noodl**. Sifted named him one of "6 European founders-to-investors to watch."

| Why this matters for the call |
| :---- |
| • He knows what it feels like to be a founder with limited runway and tough decisions — he shut down his own startup. Be authentic about challenges. • He wrote on Medium that most startup advice *"is not honest enough"* — don’t oversell. Be direct about where you are. • His Novee AI deal shows he invests in AI layers that solve domain-specific problems — directly maps to Lupe’s AI approach to marketing analytics. • His KPMG financial services background means he’ll appreciate data rigor and ROI clarity. |

# **Adverity Differentiation (Expect This Question)**

42CAP has **Adverity** in their portfolio ("Marketing Data Intelligence"). You will almost certainly be asked how Lupe differs. Here’s your answer:

| Dimension | Adverity | Lupe Analytics |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Core Value Prop** | Data integration & harmonization (ETL/connectors) | Single source of truth with semantic layer \+ AI-driven insights |
| **Data Approach** | Moves data into their platform | Works in the customer’s warehouse — no data movement overhead |
| **Data Granularity** | Aggregated marketing metrics | User-level data for granular attribution |
| **Intelligence Layer** | Dashboards & reporting | Domain knowledge woven into data models \+ AI agents |
| **Target Customer** | Enterprise marketing teams | Mobile developers / growth teams (SMB to mid-market) |
| **Competitive Moat** | Breadth of connectors | Depth of domain-specific models \+ warehouse-native architecture |

| Your 30-second Adverity answer |
| :---- |
| • *"Adverity solves the data plumbing problem — getting marketing data into one place. We start where they stop. Lupe works directly in the customer’s warehouse with user-level data, adds a semantic layer with domain-specific models, and uses AI to surface the insights that actually drive campaign decisions. We’re complementary, not competitive."* |

# **Your Narrative (Elevator Pitch)**

| The 60-Second Version |
| :---- |
| • *"Mobile developers spend millions on user acquisition across Facebook, TikTok, and Applovin — but they’re flying blind. Campaign data is fragmented across platforms, reporting is manual, and by the time insights surface, budgets have already been wasted.* • *Big companies like Supercell or King solve this with 10-person analytics teams and custom infrastructure. Everyone else is stuck with spreadsheets and gut feel.* • *Lupe Analytics gives every mobile developer the analytics infrastructure of a top publisher. We create a single source of truth directly in their data warehouse — no data movement, no overhead. On top, we layer data models with deep domain knowledge and AI that surfaces what’s working, what’s not, and what to do next.* • *We’re running a pilot with \[customer\], just onboarded a second customer, and have a third in our pipeline. Our target is €30K MRR by July."* |

# **Questions to Ask Julian**

*These questions show you’ve done your homework and position the call as a peer conversation, not a pitch.*

### **About the MarTech Opportunity**

* **"The 42CAP partners built eCircle and ran Teradata’s Marketing Cloud.** How does the team see the current MarTech landscape evolving, especially around the shift from aggregated to user-level analytics?"

* **"With Adverity in the portfolio,** you’ve seen the data integration layer mature. Do you see an opportunity in the intelligence and insights layer on top?"

### **About 42CAP’s Support**

* **"You describe your approach as ad-hoc workshops rather than regular check-ins.** What does that look like in practice for a seed-stage company finding product-market fit?"

* **"You’ve helped portfolio companies build go-to-market motions.** For a B2B product selling to mobile developers, what’s worked best in your experience?"

* **"Your conversion rate to Series A is close to 100%.** What do you typically look for in a seed company to build that confidence for follow-on?"

### **Personal Connection**

* **"You founded Karlsson and went through the WERK1 and Xpreneurs programs in Munich.** What’s the most important lesson you took from that experience into investing?"

# **Call Strategy & Reminders**

### **Tone**

Julian values honesty over polish. He explicitly wrote that most startup content isn’t honest enough. Be direct about where you are: early, focused on proving the pilot, building conviction. Don’t pretend to be further along than you are — he’ll see through it and respect the candor.

### **Structure (aim for 25–30 min)**

1. **First 2 min:** Thank him, brief context on Lupe (the 60-second pitch)

2. **Next 5 min:** Problem \+ solution deep-dive (mobile developers, fragmented data, SSOT \+ semantic layer)

3. **Next 5 min:** Traction, team, market size

4. **Next 5 min:** Adverity differentiation (proactively raise it if he doesn’t)

5. **Last 10 min:** Your questions for him \+ next steps

### **Key Messages to Land**

* We’re building the analytics infrastructure that big mobile publishers have in-house — for everyone else

* Warehouse-native, no data movement: lower cost, better security, user-level granularity

* Domain knowledge woven into the data models, not just a generic BI tool

* Clear DACH beachhead with a globally relevant product (mobile app economy is borderless)

* Two complementary founders covering business, product, full-stack, data, and ML

### **Potential Tough Questions**

* **"With 6 months of runway, why not focus on revenue instead of fundraising?"** → We are focused on revenue. The pilot is our \#1 priority. But we’re also having smart conversations with investors who understand the space.

* **"How do you get to €500M+ valuation?"** → Marketing analytics is a €12B market by 2030\. If we nail the warehouse-native \+ AI playbook for mobile, the expansion into other verticals (e-commerce, gaming, fintech apps) is natural.

* **"Two founders, no funding yet — what’s your unfair advantage?"** → Deep domain expertise in mobile UA \+ technical depth (Snowflake, dbt, multi-agent AI). We’ve built what would take a competitor 6–12 months to replicate.

* **"Why now?"** → Privacy changes (ATT, SKAdNetwork) broke traditional attribution. Companies are rebuilding their analytics stack around first-party, user-level data. That’s exactly what we enable.

*Good luck, Claudia. Be yourself — Julian will appreciate the authenticity. 🚀*
